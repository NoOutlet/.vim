This README attempts to give a clue as to how to get powerline fonts to work for vim-airline.
These commands do not work on every system, but they do seem effective on debian based distributions.

sudo mv PowerlineSymbols.otf /usr/share/fonts/PowerlineSymbols.otf
sudo mv 10-powerline-symbols.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf
sudo fc-cache -vf
